And we are here and it's a show. It's a show. It's a show. I'm excited. I'm happy that we have a show now Yes, it's official. We are here and we are so excited to bring this podcast to you. But Jay, what is this podcast? So you see when when two people love productivity, they come together. Oh, no, oh, sorry wrong story. Yeah, no, this is this is conduit
Yes, it's official. We are here and we are so excited to bring this podcast to you. But Jay, what is this podcast? So you see when when two people love productivity, they come together. Oh, no, oh, sorry wrong story. Yeah, no, this is this is conduit This is conduit a show about connecting things and honestly, this is this is your idea. You tell them. Oh, hold on now. That is a lie, sir. I distinctly remember that you made a tweet to which I replied. And then it just kind of exploded from there. So this is your fault
This is conduit a show about connecting things and honestly, this is this is your idea. You tell them. Oh, hold on now. That is a lie, sir. I distinctly remember that you made a tweet to which I replied. And then it just kind of exploded from there. So this is your fault I'm pretty sure our future is going to have a lot of it all started with a single tweet. Yes. That'll be our first shirt. All started with the tweet because good things didn't start don't start with a salad or something. We'll workshop it. Try again
I'm pretty sure our future is going to have a lot of it all started with a single tweet. Yes. That'll be our first shirt. All started with the tweet because good things didn't start don't start with a salad or something. We'll workshop it. Try again Try again. Yeah, yeah, which is something by the way that I really appreciated with this whole creation process is having somebody to talk things through with
Try again. Yeah, yeah, which is something by the way that I really appreciated with this whole creation process is having somebody to talk things through with And I something I've learned over the several weeks now that we have been preparing this show is how great you are at translating the random sounds that come out of my mouth into great words. You mean dad puns? Yes, that too. But I think they're kind of fun
And I something I've learned over the several weeks now that we have been preparing this show is how great you are at translating the random sounds that come out of my mouth into great words. You mean dad puns? Yes, that too. But I think they're kind of fun And I think that this show is going to bring some of that fun into productivity. But also some of the realities of life and how being productive is a goal, but it also means so many different things to so many different people
And I think that this show is going to bring some of that fun into productivity. But also some of the realities of life and how being productive is a goal, but it also means so many different things to so many different people And there's a reason that there are so many productivity systems and books and podcasts and all of that in the world, including on this fantastic network relay FM switch on
And there's a reason that there are so many productivity systems and books and podcasts and all of that in the world, including on this fantastic network relay FM switch on I think that it is super important to highlight that we're not we're not trying to be the only productivity podcast you ever have to listen to or anything like that. No one here is claiming to be a professional
I think that it is super important to highlight that we're not we're not trying to be the only productivity podcast you ever have to listen to or anything like that. No one here is claiming to be a professional We're we're simply just two people that have had a fascination with the productivity space for a long time. But also get that productivity is hard and not everybody's productivity journey is the same. In fact, most people you can't just read a book
We're we're simply just two people that have had a fascination with the productivity space for a long time. But also get that productivity is hard and not everybody's productivity journey is the same. In fact, most people you can't just read a book You have to apply the the messy bits in between to really get a system that works for you. And I think that that's what this show is really going to explore is how do we how do we un-mess the messy bits
You have to apply the the messy bits in between to really get a system that works for you. And I think that that's what this show is really going to explore is how do we how do we un-mess the messy bits Yeah, how do we take all of these different funnels of information and place them into our life in a way that works the best for how we work for how our brains function for how our life exists
Yeah, how do we take all of these different funnels of information and place them into our life in a way that works the best for how we work for how our brains function for how our life exists J your life is very different than mine, but we have enough similarities that we can make these connections with each other and have ideas and process things out knowing that what is right for you is not necessarily right for me
J your life is very different than mine, but we have enough similarities that we can make these connections with each other and have ideas and process things out knowing that what is right for you is not necessarily right for me But I am super excited to kind of explore to see what that means, what's going to happen and what will kind of exist. So one of the big things that you just mentioned there was that our systems aren't alike and that we have to be able to figure out what works for us
But I am super excited to kind of explore to see what that means, what's going to happen and what will kind of exist. So one of the big things that you just mentioned there was that our systems aren't alike and that we have to be able to figure out what works for us But you know, I've been podcasting product productively adjacent to you know all of the productivity pros out there
But you know, I've been podcasting product productively adjacent to you know all of the productivity pros out there And one thing that I've just learned interviewing hundreds of people about productivity things is that even though we can't just you know cart blotch copy everything that someone is doing and expected to work perfectly for us
And one thing that I've just learned interviewing hundreds of people about productivity things is that even though we can't just you know cart blotch copy everything that someone is doing and expected to work perfectly for us We can still learn from one another and a big part of the show is going to be learning from one another and challenging each other and learning from the audience that's you the people listening right now and getting amazing ideas from y'all and riffing on them and hopefully coming up with ways to improve my system throughout time
We can still learn from one another and a big part of the show is going to be learning from one another and challenging each other and learning from the audience that's you the people listening right now and getting amazing ideas from y'all and riffing on them and hopefully coming up with ways to improve my system throughout time And as time continues, the system will change. It has to change. And now we have a journey in a way to document and catalog it, but to share it also with with our friends and again, friends that that being you the people listening right now
And as time continues, the system will change. It has to change.

So at the beginning of every show, we're going to go over our connections Kathy, what's a connection? Each episode at the end of the show, we're going to kind of talk about a connection that we are going to make with ourselves, with our systems, with our business, with our productivity
Kathy, what's a connection? Each episode at the end of the show, we're going to kind of talk about a connection that we are going to make with ourselves, with our systems, with our business, with our productivity And bring an awareness to it, to the situation, whatever's going to happen so that we kind of have a little bit of a challenge for ourselves. And so we'll start off each episode talking about what happened on the episode before just a little bit. And then after that, we are going to cover topics
And bring an awareness to it, to the situation, whatever's going to happen so that we kind of have a little bit of a challenge for ourselves.

Amazing topics like dealing with jealousy of other people's situations. I don't have that problem. You got that problem. And then what to do in your productivity goes up in flames. And a problem I definitely have. I can't stop working
